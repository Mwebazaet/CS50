We can open spreadsheets in python.
We can access each title and organize them as well.
We can also use a new coding language called SQL, which is good for organizing stuff.
You only need 4 commands to work with data:
-CREATE 
-READ
-UPDATE 
-DELETE
In SQL these commands are:
-INSERT 
-SELECT
-UPDATE
-DELETE
So, in order to make a table the code would look like this:
CREATE TABLE(column data type)

SQL has many data types:
-Blob short for binary large object 
-INTEGER
   -bigint
   -integer
   -smallint
-NUMERIC
  -boolean
  -date
  -datetime
  -numeric(scale,precision) which solves floating-point imprecision by using as many bits as needed, for each digit before and after the decimal point
  -time
  -timestamp 
-REAL
  -real, for floating-point values
  -double precision, with more bits 
-TEXT
  -char(n), for an exact number of characters
  -var char(n), for a variable number of characters, up to a certain limit
  -text

There are also functions for calculations as well.
AVG
COUNT
DISTINCT, for getting distinct values without duplicates
MAX
MIN

There are also some functions for combining:
WHERE, matching on some strict condition
LIKE, matching on substrings for text
LIMIT
GROUP BY
ORDER BY
JOIN, combining data from multiple tables

For example on how use SQL, IMDB, or Internet Movie Database, has datasets available for download. 

For example, we can download title.basics.tsv.gz, which will contain basic data about titles. 
For example, for the crown it would be like this:
tconst, a identifier for each title, like tt4786824
titleType, the type of the title, like tvSeries
primaryTitle, the title, like The Crown
startYear, the year it was released, like 2016
genres, a comma-separated list of genres, like Drama,History
