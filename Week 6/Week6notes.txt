We have a new coding language, python. It's syntax is really easy-to-use. Compare the syntax of it's hello world program to c's.
python:
print("Hello world!")
C:
int main()
{
printf ("Hello world!");
}
However, this simplicity comes at a price: python programs need interpretation to actually run. 
You might need C to make a python converter. To actually run that hello world program we'd need to save it then run it on a python compiler.
We still can do lots of things with python in spite of that, such as:
-Collect input from the user:
  person = get_string("Who's that?")
  print("You're weird," + person)
-Create conditional statements: 
  var = get_string("Say something.")
  if var == "Something"
   print("good job.")
  else
   print("BAKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!)
-Pause your code for awhile. 
  print("Can we just relax?")
  sleep(69)
  print ("Nice.")
and so much more! 
Some of the data types you can use include:
-Booleans(ie. either true or false)
-Integers(numbers)
-Floats(numbers with decimals)
-Strings(Groups of letters)
-Ranges(Groups of numbers )
-lists(groups of changable values)
and much more! 
There are also directories for python. However, you have to invoke every function out of a directory to use that function. 
For example:
from cs50 import get_int
oof = get_int("How many letters are in your name?")
print ("Wow, {oof} letters!)
