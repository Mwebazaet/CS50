We have a new coding language, python. It's syntax is really easy-to-use. Compare the syntax of it's hello world program to c's.
python:
print("Hello world!")
C:
int main()
{
printf ("Hello world!");
}
However, this simplicity comes at a price: python programs need interpretation to actually run. 
You might need C to make a python converter. To actually run that hello world program we'd need to save it then run it on a python compiler.
We still can do lots of things with python in spite of that, such as:
-Collect input from the user:
  person = get_string("Who's that?")
  print("You're weird," + person)
-Create conditional statements: 
  var = get_string("Say something.")
  if var == "Something"
   print("good job.")
  else
   print("BAKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!)
and so much more! 
One really nice thing we can do is create boolean statements.
